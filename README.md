## Installation
```
mkdir ~/.themes && mkdir ~/.icons
git clone https://github.com/SAGAtheme/GTK.git
cp -r GTK/themes/. ~/.themes 
cp -r GTK/icons/. ~/icons
```

## Additional notes
If you do not want pink as an accent colour you can edit the files themselves (open the folder(s) in an editor and replace all occurrences of ```#FFC2DF``` with your own accent) or use one of the [older themes](https://github.com/SAGAtheme/GTK/tree/2d71f2f78289a1e6c3c37c18d4036e30e4c5bc3b) which offer multiple options for accent colour(s).
